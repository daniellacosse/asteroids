asteroids
=========

HTML5 Canvas realization of asteroids.

Playing:

tap WASD for a thrust in that direction<br>
spacebar to fire in direction of travel

TODOS
===

1. Fix "delete-in-place" issue: asteroids and bullets are destroyed while iterating through collision check
2. Tweak speeds (game's too fast overall) and asteroid spawn rate: enforce speed limit on ship
3. Asteroid break-ups would be cool, or at the very least some sort of little animation
4. Graphical instructions to how to play
5. OPTIONAL: Share your score on Facebook
6. OPTIONAL: Some lonely space music/a 'fire' sound
7. Come up with a good name
8. Double check to ensure we're 'framing' properly; action still speeds up randomly
