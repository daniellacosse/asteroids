asteroids
=========

HTML5 Canvas realization of asteroids.

Playing:

tap WASD for a thrust in that direction<br>
spacebar to fire in direction of travel

TODOS
===

1. Finish and implement 2d vector engine. (checkout branch 2D)
2. Add inelastic collisions for asteroids. Should be a piece of cake with the engine
3. Make the window borderless -- aka scale the canvas to the full width and height of the browser. Easier said than done.
4. Allow user to shoot by clicking.
5. Enforce max velocity and a smoother impluse.
